This is a MATLAB code for the comparison of the performance of constant and variable step size methods. The Runge-Kutta-Munthe-Kaas (RKMK) pair coming from Dormandâ€“Prince method (DOPRI 5(4), also denoted as RKMK(5,4)) is compared to RKMK of order 5 (denoted by RKMK5). The methods are tested on the N-fold 3D pendulum example.
